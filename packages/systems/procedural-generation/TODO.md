# TODO - @teskooano/systems-procedural-generation

This file tracks planned improvements and future work for the procedural generation system, based on the initial ARCHITECTURE.md.

## Future Features & Improvements

- [ ] **Surface Feature Generation**:
  - [ ] Mountains
  - [ ] Craters
  - [ ] Resource nodes / Biomes
- [ ] **Spatial Phenomena**:
  - [ ] Nebulae generation
  - [ ] Other anomalies or unique spatial features
- [ ] **Non-Celestial Elements**:
  - [ ] Derelict ships
  - [ ] Ancient ruins
  - [ ] Other points of interest
- [ ] **Advanced Parameterization**: Allow configuration beyond just the seed (e.g., pass a configuration object to `generateSystem` to influence star types, planet density, etc.).
- [ ] **More Sophisticated Planet Details**:
  - [ ] Detailed atmospheric composition and pressure
  - [ ] Axial tilt and rotation periods
  - [ ] Magnetic fields
  - [ ] Tectonic activity / Volcanism indicators
- [ ] **Improved Asteroid Belt Detail**: Define composition variance, specific large asteroids.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Investigate potential bottlenecks and consider optimizations (e.g., parallelization) if generation time becomes significant for complex systems.
- [ ] **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Add more unit tests covering edge cases and specific generator modules.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to functions and modules.
- [ ] **Refinement**: Review and refine generation algorithms based on visual results and gameplay needs.
