# TODO for @teskooano/renderer-threejs-background

This list tracks planned improvements and future tasks for the background rendering package.

## Features

- [ ] Add procedural nebula/gas cloud generation to add more visual interest to the background.
- [ ] Implement a "galaxy plane" or "milky way" style band across the skybox.
- [ ] Add occasional "shimmering" or "twinkling" effects to stars.
- [ ] Consider adding very distant, slow-moving celestial bodies to the background layers.

## Refactoring & Improvements

- [ ] Expose more configuration options in the `BackgroundManager` constructor (e.g., star counts, layer distances, animation speeds).
- [ ] Optimize star generation if performance becomes an issue with larger numbers of stars.
- [ ] Add unit tests for the manager and helper functions.
