# @teskooano/renderer-threejs-orbits

Manages the rendering of orbital lines (Keplerian ellipses, Verlet trails/predictions) within the Three.js scene.

Visibility of these orbit lines can be toggled globally via the "Show Orbit Lines" setting in the main application's Engine Settings panel. This setting defaults to true.

(More details to follow after refactor)
