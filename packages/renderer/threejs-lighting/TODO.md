# TODO

- Enhance `LightManager` to support other light types (directional, spot) if needed.
- Investigate more advanced LOD techniques beyond basic geometric simplification if performance requires it (e.g., impostors, shader-based LOD).
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for all managers and helper functions.
- Consider adding support for post-processing effects if required by the design.
