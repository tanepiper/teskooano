# Main Sequence Star Module TODO List

## Spectral Class Implementations

- [x] Class G (Sun-like yellow stars)
- [x] Class K (Orange stars)
- [x] Class M (Red dwarfs)
- [x] Class F (Yellow-white stars)
- [x] Class A (White stars)
- [x] Class B (Blue-white stars)
- [x] Class O (Blue stars)

## Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Star flares - Add the ability to simulate stellar flares with appropriate visual effects
- [ ] Star spots - Add the ability to simulate star spots (like sunspots) with appropriate visual effects
- [ ] Stellar evolution - Add support for stars to evolve over time, changing their properties
- [ ] Binary star systems - Add support for binary star systems with appropriate orbital mechanics
- [ ] Star formation - Add support for star formation from nebulae

## Documentation

- [x] Create README.md
- [x] Update ARCHITECTURE.md
- [x] Create CHANGELOG.md
- [x] Create templates for new spectral classes
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public methods and classes
- [ ] Create diagrams for the most important flows

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for base classes
- [ ] Unit tests for material creation
- [ ] Unit tests for celestial classes
- [ ] Visual regression tests for renderers

## Optimizations

- [ ] Implement instanced rendering for distant stars
- [ ] Add LOD system refinements for better performance
- [ ] Optimize shader code for better performance
- [ ] Add texture-based rendering option for very low-end devices

## Integration

- [ ] Integrate with stellar catalog data
