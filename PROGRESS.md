# Open Space 2: Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress, decisions, and challenges encountered during the implementation of major features outlined in the TODO.md file.

## Recent Focus: Renderer Stability & Performance (Post-Verlet Integration)

**Date Range:** Approx. 2025-07-30 onwards

### Overview

Following the integration of Verlet physics for orbit predictions, significant performance issues (high memory usage, excessive triangle counts) and rendering bugs (missing objects, labels, incorrect lighting) were identified. This phase focused on diagnosing and resolving these critical issues within the modular renderer architecture.

### Progress Log

- [✓] Investigated and resolved extreme memory usage (~5GB) linked to initial Verlet prediction strategy and LOD geometry.
- [✓] Investigated and resolved excessive triangle counts (~1.6M+) by correcting LOD segment definitions.
- [✓] Optimized Verlet trail/prediction rendering by updating buffer attributes instead of recreating geometry.
- [✓] Fixed invisible celestial objects by ensuring `realRadius_m` propagation via `RendererStateAdapter`.
- [✓] Fixed missing lighting on planets/moons by correcting `LightManager` integration and initialization order.
- [✓] Fixed `ObjectManager` state synchronization logic causing "Mesh not found" errors.
- [✓] Fixed CSS2D labels not rendering/toggling/hiding correctly through multiple fixes (manager instantiation, parent attachment, state tracking, direct style manipulation).
- [✓] Fixed camera resetting on UI toggle by implementing state comparison in `EnginePanel` subscription.
- [✓] Refactored gravitational lensing setup out of `ObjectManager.update`.
- [✓] Clarified scope of global vs. panel-specific view state.
- [✓] Removed debugging logs and obsolete code.

## Previous Focus: Unified Celestial Renderer Architecture

**Start Date:** 2025-04-14

### Overview

The celestial renderer system currently has inconsistencies in implementation between different celestial types. We're working on creating a unified architecture with a formal interface that all renderers will implement, standardizing LOD handling, and improving the texture generation system.

### Progress Log

#### Planning Phase

- [✓] Identified key inconsistencies (via architecture analysis)
- [✓] Established priorities for refactoring
- [✓] Created initial interface design documentation

#### Implementation Phase 1: Core Interface

- [✓] Created `CelestialRenderer` interface in `packages/systems/celestial/src/renderers/common/`
- [✓] Documented interface methods and expected behaviors
- [✓] Extracted common utility functions to shared helpers
- [✓] Created base abstract implementation classes

#### Implementation Phase 2: Renderer Refactoring

- [ ] Updated `StarRenderer` to use external GLSL files
- [ ] Refactored `TerrestrialRenderer` to implement new interface
- [ ] Refactored `GasGiantRenderer` to implement new interface
- [ ] Refactored `RingsRenderer` to implement new interface
- [✓] Standardized LOD handling across all renderer types (Initial fix via segment counts)

#### Implementation Phase 3: Texture System

- [ ] Reviewed current texture generation approaches (CPU vs. GPU)
- [ ] Designed unified texture generation framework
- [ ] Implemented improved texture caching system
- [ ] Added progressive texture loading

#### Implementation Phase 4: Quality Improvements

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Extreme Memory Usage             | Verlet predictions & LOD geometry caused GBs of RAM usage.                | Refined prediction body selection, drastically reduced LOD segments, optimized line geometry updates. | Resolved            |
| High Triangle Count              | LOD geometry for planets/moons used excessive segments (e.g., 2048x2048). | Reduced segment counts in `distance-calculator.ts` to reasonable levels.                              | Resolved            |
| Missing Object Rendering         | `realRadius_m` wasn't passed through `RendererStateAdapter`.              | Added property to interface and ensured adapter passes it.                                            | Resolved            |

| State Sync Errors                | `ObjectManager` diffing logic was flawed ("Mesh not found").              | Rewrote sync logic to use internal `objects` map as source of truth.                                  | Resolved            |
| Label Rendering Issues           | Labels didn't appear or toggle correctly.                                 | Fixed `CSS2DManager` instantiation, parent attachment, state tracking, and visibility updates.        | Resolved            |
| Camera Resets on UI Toggle       | `EnginePanel` state subscription updated camera unnecessarily.            | Added previous/new state comparison to subscription logic.                                            | Resolved            |
| Diverse renderer implementations | Current renderers follow different patterns                               | Creating formal interface with clear documentation                                                    | In Progress         |
| Varying LOD strategies           | LOD implemented differently (helpers, material methods, particle counts)  | Standardized segment counts, formal interface planned                                                 | Partially Addressed |
| Star renderer embedded shaders   | `StarRenderer` embeds shaders as strings                                  | Convert to external .glsl files like other renderers                                                  | Planned             |
| Texture generation inconsistency | Multiple approaches (CPU/Canvas & GPU/Shader)                             | Design unified framework that leverages strengths of both                                             | Planned             |
| TypeScript linting issues        | Various issues during refactoring.                                        | Addressed individually (imports, types, private access, options).                                     | Resolved            |

2. Address TODOs left during debugging (e.g., LightManager color/intensity, star type checking on removal).
3. Begin work on Physics Engine Optimization (Barnes-Hut).
4. Design unified texture generation framework.
