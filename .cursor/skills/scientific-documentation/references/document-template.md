Standalone summary covering:

1. The problem or goal addressed
2. Technical approach and core algorithms
3. Key results (what the final product does)
4. Primary CS concepts demonstrated

---

## Section 1: Introduction & Background

### 1.1 Project Motivation

- Why is this project instructive for learning programming?

### 1.2 Technical Context

- Technologies used (HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, CSS, etc.)
- Prerequisite knowledge helpful for understanding

### 1.3 Scope & Limitations

- What the project does and explicitly does _not_ do
- Simplifications or assumptions made

---

## Section 2: Development Chronology

Document complete project evolution. Adapt phases to match actual development—expand, combine, or subdivide as needed.

### 2.1 Phase I — Foundation (Prototype)

- Initial requirements and goals
- First working implementation
- What worked; what limitations emerged

### 2.2 Phase II — Iteration (Adding Complexity)

- Major feature/system/algorithm introduced
- Problem this addition solved
- Technical challenges and resolutions

### 2.3 Phase III — Refinement (Polish & Debugging)

- Visual or performance improvements
- Bug fixes with documentation of errors and solutions
- User interaction enhancements

### 2.4 Phase IV — Extension (Optional Features)

- Additional features after core completion
- Experimental additions or variations

**For each phase include:**

- Specific code changes made
- Reasoning behind each decision
- Before/after behavioral descriptions

---

## Section 3: Theoretical Framework (Core Concepts)

Identify and explain **5-7 computer science concepts** fundamental to the project.

### For Each Concept Provide:

#### 3.X.1 Formal Definition

Academic, textbook definition a CS professor would give.

#### 3.X.2 Physical Analogy

Real-world comparison using tangible objects or everyday experiences. Target zero programming background.

**Good analogy examples:**

- "An array is like a row of mailboxes, each with a numbered address"
- "A class is like a blueprint for a house—it defines structure but isn't itself a house"
- "Recursion is like standing between two mirrors and seeing infinite reflections"

#### 3.X.3 Mathematical Foundation (if applicable)

Explain formulas in plain language:

- What each variable represents
- Why the formula works
- Intuition behind the math

#### 3.X.4 Implementation Evidence

Quote exact code (with line context) where concept was applied. Explain how code embodies the theoretical principle.

---

## Section 4: Code Anatomy (Line-by-Line Analysis)

Select **30-50 most critical lines** from final codebase.

### Prioritize:

1. Mathematical "engine" (core calculations)
2. Code confusing to beginners without explanation
3. Patterns transferable to other projects

### For Each Selection Provide:

- Complete code snippet
- Line-by-line commentary explaining:
  - What the line does mechanically
  - _Why_ written this way (not just what)
  - Mathematical/logical principles embedded
  - Common beginner mistakes with similar code

**Critical:** Do NOT skip "obvious" lines. Explain every semicolon, bracket, and operator.

---

## Section 5: Technical Glossary

Comprehensive reference table with **30-50 entries**.

### Include:

- All Canvas API methods used
- All Math functions used
- All JavaScript patterns and syntax structures
- All CSS properties (if applicable)

### Table Format:

| Term | Category | Plain English Definition | Example from Code |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |

### Prioritize entries that are:

1. Domain-specific (Canvas, animation, graphics)
2. Mathematically significant
3. Likely unfamiliar to beginners

Exclude basic syntax unless it illustrates an important pattern.

---

## Section 6: Error Analysis & Debugging Log

Document every error, bug, or unexpected behavior encountered.

### For Each Error:

**6.X Error: [Error Name/Message]**

- **Symptom:** What was observed
- **Root Cause:** Why it happened (technically)
- **Solution:** How it was fixed
- **Lesson:** What principle this teaches

_This section is pedagogically critical—mistakes produce deepest learning._

---

## Section 7: Assessment & Comprehension Check

Provide **5 questions** distributed as follows:

1. **Conceptual Question** — Tests understanding of core principle
   - "Explain why [X] works the way it does."

2. **Predictive Question** — Tests mental model accuracy
   - "What would happen if we changed [Y] to [Z]?"

3. **Debugging Question** — Tests diagnostic reasoning
   - "This modification causes [unexpected behavior]. Why?"

4. **Extension Question** — Tests ability to generalize
   - "How would you modify this code to add [new feature]?"

5. **Connection Question** — Tests broader understanding
   - "What other applications could use [technique] we learned?"

**Answer Key:** Place complete answers after page break, clearly labeled "Assessment Answer Key."
