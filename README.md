# üî≠ Teskooano

Teskooano is a 3D N-Body simulation engine that accurately simulates real physics and provides a multi-view experience in real time. It features collision detection, realistic orbital mechanics, and procedural generation to create unique star systems.

> The name **Teskooano** comes from Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson by G.I. Gurdjieff. In the book, a "Teskooano" is a type of advanced telescope in Beelzebub's observatory on Mars - used to observe distant cosmic phenomena. It is designed to perceive both physical and non-physical aspects of the universe. The simulation engine is named after this device because it similarly acts as a tool for observing and exploring complex celestial systems in motion.

## Getting Started

### proto and moon

This monorepo uses [moon](https://moonrepo.dev/) and [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto) for dependency management and it's recommended you install them before launch üöÄ

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tanepiper/teskooano.git
cd teskooano

# Install dependencies and start the main app
moon run teskooano:dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## User Guide

When you first launch Teskooano, you'll be greeted with an interactive tour that will guide you through the main features of the application:

1. **Engine View**: The main 3D simulation area where you can see celestial bodies
2. **Control Panel**: Adjust simulation speed and other controls
3. **Seed Generator**: Create new star systems with procedurally generated content
4. **Focus Controls**: Select and focus on specific celestial objects
5. **Information Panels**: View detailed information about selected objects

### Using the Toolbar

- **Add View Button**: Create additional simulation views for different perspectives
- **Simulation Controls**: Play/pause and adjust simulation speed
- **Seed Generator**: Enter a seed value and click "Generate" to create a new system
- **GitHub Button**: Access the repository for reporting issues or contributing
- **Tour Button**: Restart the guided tour at any time

### Navigation

- **Orbit Controls**: Click and drag to orbit around the system
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out
- **Focus**: Select celestial bodies from the Focus Control panel to center the view

## Project Architecture

Teskooano is built as a modular system with clear separation of concerns:

### Package Structure

The application is stuctured to import TypeScript modules, which allow for a more modular approach in building the engine.
