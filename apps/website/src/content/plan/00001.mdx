I've been tinkering around the edges of the application, making some major UI changes; here is a list of what is in this release:

- **Offline First:** You can now install Teskooano as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your device - this give a full-screen experience and icon on your desktop - it works fully offline as it has no additional resources needed

- **Responsive & Mobile Friendly:** The UI is now more responsive and handles the switch between portrait and landscape and different screen sizes.

- **Performance Enhancements:** Some bugs fixed, and performance features added that allow for better performance on slower devices

- **New System UI & other enhancements:** The system components continues to work with manual seed, and now adds a random buttom, a "New System" button (currently as placeholder until the feature is developed for manual system creation) and an import/export of the system JSON (which allows for some editing)

<Slideshow

  images={[
    {
      src: "/plan/00001/fov-controls.png",
      caption: "New FOV controls allow for more fine-grained camera control",
      alt: "FOV controls screenshot",
    },
    {
      src: "/plan/00001/mobile-interface.png",
      caption: "New mobile-friendly interface in portrait mode",
      alt: "Mobile interface screenshot",
    },
    {
      src: "/plan/00001/performance.png",
      caption: "Two camera views open and still running at 120fps",
      alt: "Performance screenshot",
    },
    {
      src: "/plan/00001/new-controls.png",
      caption: "New controls for the engine view including FOV and debug tools",
      alt: "New controls screenshot",
    },
    {
      src: "/plan/00001/new-export-interface.png",
      caption:
        "New export button which allows the import/export of system data",
      alt: "Export interface screenshot",
    },
  ]}
/>

The next feature I want to work on the ability to create and edit systems, allow for more fun in setting up scenarios to test.

There are still plenty of noticable bugs, and I've added a small script to test JSON files for descrepencies - there's still some improvements to make for accuracy and performance, but perfection is the enemy of done and at the moment it's still quite feature packed.
