The controls with the red box are the _System Controls_ - here you can (in order):

- Enter your own seed using the input
- Press the first button to load this seed
- Press the second button to create and load a random seed
- Import an existing JSON file

Once a system is loaded, you will see a solar system with the camera focused on the _barycenter_

The main _Simulation Controls_ are in the green box - these allow you to speed up, slow down or reverse the direction of time - as well as pausing the simulation at any time.

The _Engine Controls_ are in the red box - here you have access to several panels:

- **Focus Panel:** This is a list of all the celestial items in the system, and allows you focus the camera or follow the object
- **Performance Panel:** This shows details of the performance of the scene
- **Celestial Info Panel:** This displays information about the currently focused celestial
- **Shader Editor Panel:** This displays the shader editor for planets
- **Engine Settings Panel:** This displays engine settings such as displaying labels, AU markers or controlling the camera FOV

Here is how you can move between planets:
