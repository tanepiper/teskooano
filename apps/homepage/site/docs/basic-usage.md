# Basic Usage Guide

This guide covers the essential features and controls of Teskooano to help you get the most out of your celestial simulation experience.

## Interface Overview

The Teskooano interface is designed to be intuitive and flexible. The main components are:

- **Toolbar**: Contains controls for simulation, system generation, and views
- **Engine View**: 3D visualization of celestial bodies and their orbits
- **Control Panels**: Information displays and controls for the simulation

## Navigating the 3D Space

### Camera Controls

- **Orbit**: Click and drag in the Engine View to orbit around the current focus point
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out
- **Pan**: Hold the middle mouse button and drag to pan the view

### Focus Controls

- **Select Object**: Choose a celestial body from the Focus Control panel
- **Auto Focus**: When enabled, the camera will automatically track the selected object
- **Reset View**: Click the "Reset Camera" button to return to the default view position

## Working with Celestial Bodies

### Object Selection

- Click on any object in the Focus Control panel to select it
- The selected object becomes the focus point for camera orbiting
- The Celestial Info panel updates to show details about the selected object

### Object Information

The Celestial Info panel displays:

- **Basic Properties**: Name, type, mass, radius
- **Orbital Parameters**: Semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination (for orbiting bodies)
- **Physical Characteristics**: Surface type, atmosphere (for planets)
- **Star-specific Data**: Spectral class, temperature, luminosity (for stars)

## Simulation Controls

### Time Management

- **Play/Pause**: Toggle the simulation on and off
- **Time Scale**: Adjust how quickly time passes in the simulation:
  - 1x: Real-time (one second in the simulation equals one second in real life)
  - 10x to 10,000,000x: Accelerated time to observe long-term orbital behavior

### System Generation

- **Seed Generator**: Create new star systems by entering a seed value
- **Regenerate**: Keep the same seed but regenerate the system (useful for trying different variations)

## Multiple Views

Teskooano supports multiple simultaneous views of the same simulation.

### Creating Views

- Click the "Add View" button in the toolbar to create a new Engine View
- Each view maintains its own camera position and focus object
- Views share the same simulation data, so changes in one view affect all views

### View Arrangements

- Drag and drop view tabs to rearrange them
- Views can be positioned side by side, stacked, or in a grid pattern
- Resize views by dragging the dividers between them

## Renderer Settings

### Visual Options

- **Show Orbits**: Toggle the display of orbital paths
- **Show Labels**: Toggle the display of object labels
- **Show Grid**: Toggle the reference grid for scale

### Performance Settings

- **LOD Quality**: Adjust the Level of Detail for improved performance on slower machines
- **Anti-aliasing**: Enable or disable for better visual quality

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Focus on Smaller Bodies**: When studying moons or asteroids, focus directly on them rather than trying to find them visually
- **Multiple Views Strategy**: Use multiple views to observe the same system at different scales (e.g., one view showing the entire system, another focused on a particular planet)
- **Time Management**: Use slower time scales for detailed observation of close encounters, and faster scales for observing complete orbits
- **System Comparisons**: Generate multiple systems with different seeds to compare variations in planetary arrangements

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Space**: Play/Pause simulation
- **+/-**: Increase/decrease time scale
- **R**: Reset camera
- **G**: Toggle grid
- **O**: Toggle orbits
- **L**: Toggle labels
