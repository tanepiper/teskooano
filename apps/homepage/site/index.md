## Teskooano in Action

<ScreenshotCarousel />

## Observe The Cosmos Like Never Before

Teskooano (pronounced tes-koo-ah-no) is an advanced 3D simulation engine that recreates the physics of celestial bodies with reasonable accuracy.

## Key Capabilities

### Accurate Celestial Physics

Teskooano implements full N-Body gravitational simulation, meaning every object in the system exerts gravitational force on every other object. Watch as planets orbit stars, moons orbit planets, and complex gravitational interactions create realistic celestial motion.

### Real-time Visualization

Built on Three.js, Teskooano renders complex celestial systems in real-time with physically accurate lighting, materials, and effects. The visualization engine can handle hundreds of objects while maintaining smooth performance.

### Interactive Learning Platform

Perfect for educational settings, Teskooano makes complex orbital mechanics intuitive and accessible. Experiment with different planetary configurations, observe gravitational interactions, and learn about celestial mechanics through direct observation.

### Seamless User Experience

When you first launch Teskooano, an interactive guided tour introduces you to all key features. The intuitive DockView-based UI allows for customizable layouts to suit your specific needs.

## Built With Modern Tech

Teskooano leverages cutting-edge web technologies including:

- **Three.js** for 3D rendering and visualization
- **TypeScript** for type-safe development
- **Nanostores** for lightweight, efficient state management
- **Driver.js** for interactive tours
- **DockView** for flexible multi-panel layouts

## Open Source & Community Driven

Teskooano is completely open source under the MIT license. We welcome contributions, bug reports, and feature requests from the community.
