I've been tinkering around the edges of the application, making some major UI changes; here is a list of what is in this release:

- **Offline First:** You can now install Teskooano as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your device - this give a full-screen experience and icon on your desktop - it works fully offline as it has no additional resources needed

- **Responsive & Mobile Friendly:** The UI is now more responsive and handles the switch between portrait and landscape and different screen sizes.

- **Performance Enhancements:** Some bugs fixed, and performance features added that allow for better performance on slower devices

- **New System UI & other enhancements:** The system components continues to work with manual seed, and now adds a random buttom, a "New System" button (currently as placeholder until the feature is developed for manual system creation) and an import/export of the system JSON (which allows for some editing)

    { src: 'new-export-interface.png', caption: 'New export button which allows the import/export of system data' }
  ]"
/>

The next feature I want to work on the ability to create and edit systems, allow for more fun in setting up scenarios to test.

There are still plenty of noticable bugs, and I've added a small script to test JSON files for descrepencies - there's still some improvements to make for accuracy and performance, but perfection is the enemy of done and at the moment it's still quite feature packed.
